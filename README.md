## RESTful Web Microservices Two-Day Workshop

 * The [Agenda](agenda.md) -- The two-day course highlights.
 * Your [Prerequisites](prerequisites.md) -- What you'll need to know ahead of time.

### Workshop Description

*Skill Level: Advanced*

In this two-day hands-on workshop, attendees will learn to design, build, and deploy stand-alone microservices that can easily interoperate with other microservices in a Web-based ecosystem. All service examples will be shown in both C#/Azure and NodeJS/Heroku. Deployments will be done via git/Github repositories. 

Attendees will learn:
 * What is a RESTful microservice?
 * Selecting your microservices cloud platform
 * Microservice design patterns 
 * The three kinds of microservice models and when to use them
 * How to implement interoperable microservices
 * How to create microservices that can "find-and-bind" at runtime
 * The three pillars of governance for RESTful microservices

Through a mix of lectures and hands-on assignments, attendees will work through the full lifecycle of microservice design, implementation, and deployment. All services built and used within the workshop will be available via public internet and hosted on well-known platforms. At the end of the workshop attendees will have fully-implemented, running RESTful microservices ready to use in production systems.

If you're looking for a hands-on, intensive deep dive into working microservices, this is the workshop for you.
